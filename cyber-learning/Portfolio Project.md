ZTNA in the cloud with EDR & DLP

along with IDP/IAM and email security to safe guard mock org

Multiple systems to admin
&
Multiple  end points to secure along with identities

Two biggest security concerns:
- human use of tech
- identities being secured
(How to safeguard business from these two)

## List of key term:
 ZTNA
 - Zero Trust Network Access
 - Ensures all user and devices are verified and authorized before accessing applications and data regardless of location
 - Assume threats are both inside and outside of the network
 - Trust no entity by default

EDR
- Endpoint Detection and Response
- focuses on detecting and investigating suspicious activities and endpoints like laptops, desktops, and servers
- Analyzes data in realtime to identify potential threats and provide response capabilities to mitigate risk

NDLP
- Network Data Loss Prevention
- security technology that prvents the unauthorized transmission of sensitive data outside the network
- Monitors data in motion and at rest, applies policies to identify and prevent data breaches and provide visibility into data usage and movement

### Project Prompt
I need to create a project for my cybersecurity portfolio for a new job.

I want to use Azure Cloud to implement ZTNA with EDR and DLP. It will be necessary to use IDP/IAM for email security. This will be a multiple systems to admin project and will have multiple endpoints to secure along with identities.
